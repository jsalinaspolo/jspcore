Once again, it has been a while since the last time that I found the motivation and time to write a post. Might be 
that with the beginning of the new year, usually, comes back the idea to write more posts, let's see if this year I manage to write more.

2018 is almost over and I am taking a break with the family in the fresh and cold Moscow, hence I had some time to look back on 2018.

#### Professionally
* Accepted the challenge at Zopa. Helping to build the "new online banking" - focus on the Credit Card product.
* At times, failed as a Lead to the team.
* Built up a team embracing Extreme Programming practices, making a team up to ten developers who enjoy working pairing.
* Pushed my self to give a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eVyAyDIlNs) at a conference, but I need to improve my delivery at talks.
* Contributed to open source projects as [JGiven](https://github.com/TNG/JGiven) and [Ratpack](https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack). Also, I kept up-to-date [LogCapture](https://github.com/mustaine/logcapture).
* Did not find the time to read books.

#### Personally
* I have seen how the youngest kid made his first year.
* Moved with the family from London to Barcelona, after 6 amazing years in the UK.
* I have seen how my oldest child started school in Barcelona and how quickly he adapted to Spanish and Catalan.
* I did not spend enough time with my family.
* Once I moved to Barcelona, did not make time to meet some friends.

Looking back, I think it has been a very intense year - personally and professionally. Therefore, I asked myself, what do I expect in 2019?

#### Personally
* Spend more quality time with the family.
* Make time to meet the friends.
* Plan more weekends with the family.
* Visit [@felipefzdz](https://twitter.com/felipefzdz) in Canary Island.
* Have more time to practice Tennis.

#### Professionally
* Deliver one fresh talk in 2019.
* Write a post every 2 months in the blog.
* Improve leadership skills, especially around empathy.
* Deliver to customers the amazing Zopa Credit Card.
* Keep contributing to open source projects.
* Read a few technical books again.

I am a bit skeptical about a year retrospective, but this year I have decided to give it a try. Let me know in the **comments** 
if you decide to do it.
