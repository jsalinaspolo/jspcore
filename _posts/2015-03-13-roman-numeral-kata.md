In order to practice [Test-Driven-Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), I did the [Roman Numerals Kata](https://github.com/mustaine/katas/tree/master/roman-numerals).

TDD has 3 simple steps, even their are easy, it is difficult to educate yourself to follow them

 1. Write a failing test
 2. Write the simplest bit of code that makes it pass
 3. Refactor the code to follow the rules of simple design
